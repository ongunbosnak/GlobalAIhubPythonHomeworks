#Create a Simple Student Management System:

# -One student must enter their name and surname.
# -A student who enter name and surname correctly should write "welcome" on the screen with print. 
# The Student has the right to enter his/her name and surname incorrectly 3 times. For more than
# 3 inccorect entiries, the system shuts down and the message "Please try again later" 
# should be printed on the screen.
# -5 courses should be created and those courses should be kept in a list.
# All of these lessons be taken from the user.
# -This student can take minimum of 3 and maximum of 5 lessons.
# -This student can not take less than 3 courses.
# -Otherwise the message 'You failed in class' should be returned to student by using return statement.
# -The student must choose one of these courses and take an exam. Add the grades from this 
# course to a dictionary and keep the student's grades in this dictionary as midterm, 
# final and project grades.
# *Example: {'midterm':38, 'final':68, 'project':89}
#  -Percentages for grades
#  -Midterm Exam: %30
#  -Final Exam: %50
#  -Project: %20
# -Determine a course passing grade according to the grades received.
#  -For notes,
#             - If the grade is>90, the student should get AA
#             - If 70<grade<90 BB
#             - If 50<grade<70 CC
#             - If 30<grade<50 DD
#             - If x<30 FF, let FF take
#     - if student has received FF, he/she should print his/her failure on screen.
